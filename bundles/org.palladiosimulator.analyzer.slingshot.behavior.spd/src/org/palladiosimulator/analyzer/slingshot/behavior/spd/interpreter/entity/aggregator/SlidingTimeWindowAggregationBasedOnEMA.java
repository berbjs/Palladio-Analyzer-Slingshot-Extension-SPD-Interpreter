/**
 * The {@link #SlidingTimeWindowAggregationBasedOnEMA(int, double, double)} implements an
 * exponential moving average. Similarly, to other WindowAggregation(s), it allows to define a
 * {@link #durationNoEmit} to control the emitting frequency.
 * 
 * In addition, it provides a smoothingFactor that defines the weight of a new value to the
 * aggregated value.
 *
 * This implementation does not allow the application of arbitrary aggregation functions. It
 * implements a moving average.
 * 
 * Further, the implementation makes the following assumption: It assumes that when no value is
 * added for a certain time period, then the utilization of the resource is 0 during that period.
 * This is happening because of the current implementation that updates the resource state only when
 * Jobs arrive or leave.
 * 
 * Implications:
 * 
 * To compensate, this implementation, corrects the EMA model by multiplying the resulting
 * utilization with an exponential factor that depends on the time difference between the last
 * update and the recent one. The farther the last update time the more zeros are assumed and the
 * more the overall utilization is decreased.
 * 
 * Caution: This EMA Aggregation method is suitable for how the utilization of active resources is
 * implemented in Slingshot. It may not be applicable to other types of measurements.
