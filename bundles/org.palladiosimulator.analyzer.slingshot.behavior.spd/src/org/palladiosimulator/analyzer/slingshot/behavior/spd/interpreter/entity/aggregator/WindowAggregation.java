/**
 * The WindowAggregation interface defines the contract of how aggregations are
 * supposed to be processed in context of SPD.
 * 
 * A ScalingPolicy applies to a TargetGroup which in PCM can be a set of
 * ResourceContainers or AssemblyCtxts. If the policy uses triggers that as
 * stimulus use {@link ManagedElementsStateStimulus}, for example a
 * CPUUtilizationTrigger, then several measurements source from elements that
 * are within the scope of the TargetGroup.
 * 
 * This interface provides three methods that are necessary to provide a
 * meaningful workflow of handling the described case.
 * 
 * First, {@link #aggregate(double, double)} allows to share to the
 * WindowAggregator a new value which can be sourced from one of the elements.
 * When that value is passed to the WindowAggregation, then the policy looses
 * track of the individual identity of the measurement (or its source identity).
 * 
 * The {@link #isEmittable()} allows for the client (i.e., a TriggerChecker) to
 * check whether it is worth emitting an aggregate value for analysis. An
 * implementation could use this method to implement rate limitting behavior
 * (e.g., emitting a value every 10 seconds) or to constraint the emitting based
 * on the number of datapoints in the window.
 * 
 * The {@link #getCurrentValue()} allows to retrieve the current aggregated
 * value. The method must throw an AssertionError in case {@link #isEmittable()}
 * returns false.
